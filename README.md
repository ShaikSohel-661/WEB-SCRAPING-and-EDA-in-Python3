# WEB-SCRAPING-and-EDA-in-Python3
Web Scraping and EDA in Python 3 using Requests, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

The process is as follows:

1.use Python's requests and bs4 libraries to scrape a webpage

2.load the scraped data into a pandas dataframe

3.do some basic exploratory data anlaysis on the dataframe

4.basic visualization

For this project purpose I scraped movies data from IMDB from official imdb website - https://www.imdb.com/ 

## **Final note :**


Please note that I documented this jupyter notebook for a simple way to explain how useful it is to scrape website data using requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4) libraries.

Feel free to do your own exploration and analysis on the data that is scraped.

I hope that this piece of work will give readers some basic understanding of web scraping and intuition behind the analysis, which is:

    *from scraping data to end-to-end data analysis (if I might say in simple words)
